I am a data scientist at Walmart working under [John List](https://voices.uchicago.edu/jlist/).

Before Walmart, I majored in economics and mathematics at Columbia. While there, I was lucky enough to work on a paper with [Alessandra Casella](https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/ac186/) and write a thesis supervised by [Jonah Rockoff](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jrockoff/). 

My interests are broad but I am most interested in applied econometrics, (normative) decision theory, education, and labor. Feel free to reach me via email at joseph.campbell at columbia.edu.
