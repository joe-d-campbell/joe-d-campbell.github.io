I am a data scientist at Walmart working under [John List](https://voices.uchicago.edu/jlist/).

Before Walmart, I majored in economics and mathematics at Columbia.

My interests are broad but I am most interested in applied econometrics, labor (especially education), and IO. Feel free to reach me via email at joseph.campbell at columbia.domainSuffixUniversitiesUse .
